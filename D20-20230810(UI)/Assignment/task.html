                Galleries appear as long, narrow rooms in substantial Renaissance houses and palaces, where they were used as promenades and to exhibit art. In Elizabethan and Jacobean houses these 
                were called long galleries.A photograph (also known as a photo, image, or picture) is an image created by light falling on a photosensitive surface, 
                usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor, such as a CCD or a CMOS chip.</small>
